Boreal woodland caribou are also known as southern mountain caribou, woodland caribou, and forest-dwelling caribou. Mountain caribou are uniquely adapted to live in old-growth forests. The mountain caribou diet consists of tree-dwelling lichens predominantly. They are unique in this aspect as in the far northern regions of their habitat zones, the snowpack is shallow enough that the boreal woodland caribou can paw through the snow to eat the ground-dwelling lichens. In the inland Pacific Northwest Rainforests of eastern British Columbia, where the snowpack can reach upwards of five meters, the mountain caribou rely predominantly on the tree-dwelling lichens such as Bryoria spp. and Alectoria spp., hanging above the snowpack. As a result, these mountain caribou are reliant upon the old growth forests, which have been logged for centuries and continue to dwindle. History of conservation efforts\n",
      "Conservation efforts began in the mid-50s with the southward expansion of the Wells Gray Provincial Park north of Kamloops, British Columbia and west of Jasper National Park with the focus to protect the dwindling herds of mountain caribou. The areas set aside by further Canadian National Parks – Glacier National Park (Canada), the Purcell Wilderness Conservancy Provincial Park and Protected Area, Valhalla Provincial Park – are not as conducive for the specially adapted caribou as these areas are mostly ice, rock, alpine meadows and sub-alpine parkland and are lacking in the old-growth forests which provide the tree-dwelling lichens pivotal to the mountain caribou diet.\"\n",
