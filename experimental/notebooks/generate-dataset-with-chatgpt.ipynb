All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.',\n",

In this paper, we present calculations of prompt diphoton production cross sections at various energies. We use the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) formalism to accurately predict the cross sections. Our calculations include the effects of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and higher-order QCD corrections. We analyze the dependence of the cross sections on various kinematic variables, such as the transverse momentum of the diphoton system and the rapidity separation between the photons. We also compare our predictions with available experimental data from the Tevatron and LHC. Our results can be useful for studies of Standard Model processes as well as for searches of new physics phenomena that may manifest through diphoton signatures at the colliders.',\n",

Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years.

The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1).

An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.

Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al.

The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades.

In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.',\n",

The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response.',\n",

We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it.

We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h.

In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides.

We have used a custom-built burner to generate a premixed laminar flame front and investigated its interaction with a multi-frequency pulsed laser beam. We have observed that the laser beam induces self-phase modulation and generates a set of bifurcations leading to previously unreported non-linear optical effects in the flame, including self-narrowing, self-structuring, and self-focusing. The observed effects have been characterized using a spectrometer, a polarimeter, and a high-speed camera. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the laser-flame interaction can be used to generate a new type of photonic flame effect, namely a laser-induced deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT), which is a highly nonlinear and complex physical process. Our experiments indicate that DDT can be triggered by a suitable choice of the laser beam properties, such as its frequency, pulse duration, spot size, and intensity. These findings open up new possibilities for the control and manipulation of flames using photonic techniques and suggest potential applications in combustion science and engineering.',\n",

The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated.',\n",

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit\\'s inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

Moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te.\",\n",

In this study, we investigate the switching mechanism of these derivatives in molecular junctions using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Our results reveal that the photoinduced isomerization from the open to the closed form occurs via a conical intersection pathway. The formation of the closed form induces a significant change in the electronic transport properties, including a decrease in the conductance and an increase in the rectification ratio. We also demonstrate that the switching behavior depends on the anchoring group and the electrode configuration, indicating that the switching mechanism can be tailored for specific device applications.

We find that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest. Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations.

The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling. Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action.

Our classification scheme is based on the symmetry structure of the superpotential, which is determined by the charges of the fields under various symmetries. We show that the superpotential can be classified into several distinct classes, each with a unique symmetry structure. Moreover, we find that different classes of superpotentials are related by analytic continuation. Using our classification scheme, we analyze several examples of superpotentials, including those appearing in gauged linear sigma models and in the context of F-theory. We demonstrate that our approach allows for a systematic classification of superpotentials, which can facilitate the identification of symmetry structures and the exploration of their physical implications.

Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.',\n",

The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.',\n",

Basaltic asteroids can be identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors.

The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of 0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface.

Moreover, we obtain estimates for the boundary values in terms of the layer potentials. Our results generalize and improve upon earlier works by several authors, and they have potential applications in various areas of mathematical and physical sciences, such as elasticity, acoustics, and electromagnetic theory.',\n",

       "  \"(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.\",\n",

Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars. Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days. Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level) magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn from the same parent distribution.

As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution.

The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

This accretion may manifest itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary UZ Tau E.

The variability of the H-alpha line is not as clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component is not ruled out.

The spectral sequence of blazars, ranging from radio to gamma-rays, provides a unique opportunity to study the physics of AGN jets and their interaction with the surrounding environment. With the launch of the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), which will extend coverage to the high-energy gamma-ray regime, it is crucial to understand the blazar spectral sequence in this energy range to optimize GLAST's observations. In this paper, we present a study of the blazar spectral sequence using data from Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, and ground-based observatories. We find that the gamma-ray flux is strongly correlated with the optical and X-ray fluxes, as expected from inverse Compton scattering models. However, we also observe a lack of correlation between the radio and gamma-ray fluxes, suggesting a potential break in the correlation between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components of the emission. These results have important implications for the interpretation of GLAST observations and the development of theoretical models for blazar emission.\",\n",

We believe this model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio becomes smaller then the local population size.

The loops exhibit periodic torsional oscillations, which are characterized by a phase shift between the footpoints of the loop. The torsional waves were found to be excited by the kink instability in the inhomogeneous loop, which causes the loop to twist and gives rise to the observed oscillations. The damping rate of the torsional waves was found to be significantly lower than that of the transverse kink waves. The longitudinal density profile of the loop was found to have a significant effect on the torsional oscillations, with the damping rate increasing in regions of decreasing density.

In this paper, we present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of their rate-1/3 parent codes.

PRP addresses this issue by selectively puncturing the systematic bits of the Turbo Code with a pseudo-random pattern, which creates a more diverse error-correcting capability. This novel approach is demonstrated to improve the performance of Turbo Codes by up to 2 dB at the error floor, while maintaining similar performance at high signal-to-noise ratios.

Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction field), gives the next to leading order evolution.

The modal solutions are obtained by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem of Maxwell's equations using transfer-matrix method. The dispersion relations reveal that the leaky modes are strongly dispersive and show negative group velocity.

Second, we linearize the equations of motion for small perturbations around these equilibrium configurations, to study their linear stability. We find that, in general, quasi-toroidal polytropes are unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations, which can trigger fragmentation, leading to the formation of multiple, smaller quasi-toroidal polytropes. Furthermore, we find that the threshold for instability depends on the polytropic index, the ratio of radial to tangential pressure, and the dimensionality of the perturbation.

By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic'' type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes).

In this paper we demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense. Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.\",\n",

A key issue examined is the determination of the so-called \"color correction factor\", which is often empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion rate, among a number of important factors.

We show that the spectra can be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra with other models.

We thus focus on Double Chooz (Phase I & II), Daya Bay (Phase I & II) and RENO experiments. We perform a unified analysis, including systematics, backgrounds and accurate experimental setup in each case. Each identified systematic error and background impact has been assessed on experimental setups following published data when available and extrapolating from Double Chooz acquired knowledge otherwise. After reviewing the experiments, we present a new analysis of their sensitivities to sin^2(2 theta_13) and study the impact of the different systematics based on the pulls approach. Through this generic statistical analysis we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of each experimental setup.',\n",

       "  'In this work, we present a unified analysis of the reactor neutrino program with the aim of measuring the $\\\\theta_{13}$ mixing angle. Using the data from the Daya Bay, Double Chooz and RENO experiments, we have implemented a consistent statistical framework that includes the necessary systematic uncertainties and correlations. Our analysis is based on a Bayesian approach, where the posterior distribution of the mixing angle and other oscillation parameters is obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We find a value of $\\\\sin^2 \\\\theta_{13} = 0.022 \\\\pm 0.001$ with a significance of 7.2$\\\\sigma$, which is in agreement with previous measurements from reactor experiments as well as results from long-baseline accelerator experiments. Our analysis also includes the determination of the systematic uncertainties as well as the correlation matrix among the parameters, which can be useful for future reactor experiments. Overall, our results contribute to the precision measurement of the $\\\\theta_{13}$ mixing angle and provide valuable information for the understanding of neutrino oscillations.',\n",

       "  'We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of the strategies on different routes.',\n",

       "  'In cooperative wireless networks, decode-and-forward (DF) is a prominent relaying strategy whereby a relay decodes and retransmits the message to the destination node. Generally, routing in DF cooperative networks is accomplished using a shortest path algorithm. However, the resulting path may not reflect the network conditions, causing suboptimal performance in terms of throughput and energy efficiency. This paper presents an optimal routing algorithm for DF-based cooperation in wireless networks, which considers the network topology, interference, and power allocation constraints to improve network performance. The proposed algorithm selects relay nodes with the highest signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and allocates power among them optimally. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through extensive simulations, showing that the proposed technique outperforms the shortest path algorithm in terms of throughput and energy efficiency.',\n",

We prove that if a finite group has a polynomial automorphism of prime degree, then it is isomorphic to a semidirect product of a nilpotent group and a cyclic group. We also demonstrate that if a group has a polynomial automorphism of degree $p^2$ for some prime $p$, then it is a Frobenius group, and we determine the structures of such groups. Furthermore, we determine the structures of abelian groups with polynomial automorphisms. Finally, we classify the dihedral groups and the symmetric groups with polynomial automorphisms up to degree 6. These results provide insights into the algebraic structures and symmetries of finite groups, and may have applications in fields such as cryptography and coding theory.',\n",
